    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Is this really about me? Or maybe it's about something else...?</p>
    <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
      <p>I did take a java class back in freshman year of college, but it was a big class and I ended up getting paired with some one who wasn't interested in helping me, some one new to developing, with learning the ropes as they had already enough experience to find, and usually did, ways to write code that wasn't part of the instructions, but still completed the project requirements.</p>
      <p>With the recent acquisition of an HTC Vive vr headset though, my fascination in developing and coding resurfaced and I decided to try Codefellows and thoroughly enjoyed the 100 and 102 classes.</p>
